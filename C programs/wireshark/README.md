in this folder "wireshark" you will find 

**1 -** the output from a run for the 2 programs

   1-1- curl_multi (the problem reproduced clearly with 0 successifull connections)
   
   1-2- curl_threads (the normal expected behaviour with 63 successifull connections)

**2 -** the wireshark filters (capture/disply) for the same 407 proxies used by the 2 C programs

**3-** the 2 raw wireshark files `.pcapng` I captured while running both the programs
